## Example data-vs-time proxy adapter targets

Currently there are two:

1. A minimal but fully featured example written in **go** (working but not quite finished).
2. A more substantial currency echange rate example in **C#** 
(targeting CoreCLR) that sources data from an InfluxDb database.
Note that functionality for acquiring the currency data is not
included.

more soon, in particular a minimal example in **python**
